# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Before implementing any feature, ALWAYS check '.reference' folder for TypeScript Zod v4 source. Consult the reference to ensure API compatibility."
  - "Follow SOLID, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principles."
  - "Maximize code reuse whenever possible."
  - "Follow '.agents/rules/' guides before writing new code."
  - "All schemas must implement both Parse (runtime flexibility) and StrictParse (compile-time type safety) methods."
  - "Use Copy-on-Write pattern for modifiers — always clone internals before modification."
  - "Never bypass engine APIs (ParsePrimitive/ParseComplex) — maintains consistent modifier handling."
  - "Follow [Google Go Best Practices](https://google.github.io/go-style/best-practices)"
  - "Follow [Google Go Decisions](https://google.github.io/go-style/decisions)"
  - "Follow [Google Go Formatting](https://google.github.io/go-style/formatting)"

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
